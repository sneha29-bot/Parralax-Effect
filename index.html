Technically, adventure is an unusual & daring experience. People usually go for an adventure trip in their leisure time so as to revive their spirit after utterly exhausting schedule of routine life.
                <br> <br>
                While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed.

            </div>

            <p class="text"> A bicycle is a useful vehicle that helps us reach a destination without polluting the environment. It is composed of steel and has two wheels. In addition, it has got a seat and handle with two pedals and also a bell. Some bicycles have a carrier while some don’t. It is a popular choice amongst poor people and students. Essay on bicycle will help us understand its importance.
                <br> <br>
                Mountain biking brings a solitude on the trails that causes us to forget about our day-to-day problems and responsibilities. It demands we focus on the present moment. Maybe it is the speed, or perhaps it's the obstacles presented on single-track that forces one to be in the moment and starts the flow. Or it could be being out in the woods burning on the side of a mountain, barreling over rock gardens and zipping by shrubbery with no worries about the rocks you kick up behind you. In your head, no one is keeping up with you. It becomes just you and the trail. Something about it all makes mountain biking alone a cherished time well spent.

                <h2 class="desc"> SURFING </h2>
            </div>

            <P class="text"> Today, surfing is one of the most popular and most preferred extreme sports in the world. It is done by riding the waves in the sea or the ocean by standing or lying on a surfboard.  This extreme sport, which is thought to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere in ancient times, was a necessity rather than entertainment or a hobby. Used as a way to return to the shore from the ships originally, surfing became a hobby with time and an official sport in 1920.
                <br> <br>
                If you want to surf, you will require some balance and durability. You should not lose your balance while standing on the surfboard and on the water. Before trying this sport, you should do some basic training that will improve your balance and endurance. You can prepare yourself for this extreme sport by going to surfing courses. When surfing, all you need is a surfboard. When you find the harmony between the sea and the wind, you can easily enjoy surfing.

                <h2 class="desc"> PARAGLIDING </h2>
            </div>

            <P class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paraglide: lightweight, free- flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track.
                <br> <br>
                The first thing to decide on is the type of paragliding that you want to practice. The glider is made from one canopy. The entire mechanism represents the one of a parachute. The gliding principle is the same. However, given that the paraglider is lighter and more portable, it is easier to fly. You can readily start training for this discipline in any of the paragliding schools. Once you master the necessary skills, you can you can start on your own.
